# HR2 black back ground
Notes for updating csv file:
- first and last 3 rows will not appear on the drop-down box (this is because the program works by utilizing an array of bg numbers made up of the selected number + the 3 values before and the 3 values after; therefore the visible/selectable bg readings for users to interact with start 3 values into the csv file and end 3 values before the end of the csv file)
